# Defines the set of Connections to cloud systems to expose as database
# schemas in Unify. Each connection item should indicate the system
# adapter, plus `options` which generally will specifify authentcation
# values. The option keys are specific to each adapter.
#
# The connection name is used as the database schema name, and it is typical
# to just use the system adapter name. But the connection names are distinct
# to that you can have multiple connections to the same type of system that
# are mapped as separate schemas (like `jira1` and `jira2`).
#
# You can embed authentication values here in this file, or for better 
# security you can read them from the environment by referencing
# environment variables using `$variable` syntax.
